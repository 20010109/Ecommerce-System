1. User Authentication and Product Browsing
Auth Service:

The user logs into the system via the Auth Service, which validates their credentials and issues an authentication token (typically a JWT).

This token is then attached to subsequent API requests to prove the user's identity.

Product Service:

The user browses the product catalog, which is managed by the Product Service.

The Product Service returns product details, including prices, descriptions, and available variants.

2. Adding Product to Cart and Initiating Checkout
Order Service (DOMA):

When the user adds a product to their cart and proceeds to checkout, the frontend sends a request to the Order Service.

The Order Service creates a new order record in its own database, associating it with the authenticated user.

At this stage, the order’s status is typically marked as “pending.”

Communication:

The Order Service does not directly query other service databases but might make an API call or listen to events from the Product Service to verify product details and availability.

3. Inventory Verification
Inventory Service:

Before finalizing the order, the Order Service sends a REST API request (or publishes an event) to the Inventory Service to check whether the requested product (and its variant) is in stock.

The Inventory Service verifies stock levels and, if sufficient, reserves the quantity to prevent overselling.

Outcome:

If the Inventory Service confirms availability, the process continues.

If not, the Order Service can respond to the frontend with a message (e.g., "Product out of stock") or trigger a compensating action.

4. Payment Processing
Payment Service:

Once the inventory is verified, the Order Service communicates with the Payment Service to initiate payment processing.

The Payment Service handles the transaction, interacting with payment gateways or banks, and returns the payment status.

Order Update:

Depending on the Payment Service’s response:

If payment is successful, the Order Service updates the order status to "completed" or "paid."

If payment fails, the Order Service might update the order status to "failed" or "canceled" and notify the user accordingly.

5. Finalizing the Order and Post-Processing
Event-Driven Updates:

The Order Service might publish an event indicating that an order has been placed successfully.

Other services (like a Notification Service) can subscribe to these events to send confirmation emails, update user dashboards, or trigger further processes (e.g., shipment scheduling).

Data Isolation:

Each service writes to its own database. For instance, the Order Service logs order details, the Inventory Service updates stock levels, and the Payment Service records transaction data.

Communication occurs through API calls or messaging queues, ensuring that changes in one service’s database do not directly affect another’s.

Summary Flow
Authentication:

User logs in via the Auth Service.

Product Browsing:

User reviews products via the Product Service.

Order Creation:

The frontend calls the Order Service to create an order (status: “pending”).

Inventory Check:

The Order Service requests the Inventory Service to reserve the product quantity.

Payment:

Payment Service processes the payment, and the Order Service updates the order status accordingly.

Post-Processing:

The system publishes order events for further processing (e.g., sending emails, scheduling shipments).
